# TAKE AWAY- Food Ordering Website
This project was a great learning experience that deepened my understanding of state management, middleware, and practices in React development. 
# 🛠️ Key Technologies Used:
📍React ⚛️ for crafting a responsive user interface

📍redux and react-redux 🔄 for global state management

📍redux-thunk 🧵 for handling asynchronous actions and API communication

📍axios 🌐 for HTTP requests

📍react-router-dom 🗺️ for navigation

📍uuid 🔢 for generating IDs

📍react-icons 🎨 for icons

📍tailwindcss 🖌️ for modern, utility-first styling

📍json-server 💾 for simulating a backend API
# 🔍 What I Learned:
✔️ Middleware with redux-thunk: I learned how middleware connects the API and the store, making state management more efficient and responsive.

✔️ Code Reusability: Using Redux and thunk reduced repetitive code, making the project easier to maintain and organize.

✔️ Component-based Development: With good state management, handling even complex UI interactions became simpler and more manageable.
